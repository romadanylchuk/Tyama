/**
 * ring-state.ts — Pure graded ring-state derivation (Stage 06, Phase 4).
 *
 * THE GAMIFICATION CORE IS THE SKILL GRAPH, MADE VISIBLE (brief §"Context"):
 *   `fill` is ALWAYS the raw stage-04 mastery `aggregate` scalar — there is no
 *   second progress source, no independently-tracked ring percentage. A
 *   novice on the CPA trajectory sees nonzero fill immediately.
 *
 * ANTI-SHAME INVARIANT (the load-bearing property of this module):
 *   The `RingState` union has NO 'locked' member and NO loss/decrease state.
 *   A windowed mastery scalar that eases back down below `masteryThreshold`
 *   simply returns to `'in-progress'` — never a special "you lost mastery"
 *   state, never a color/label change that reads as a penalty. This is
 *   asserted by `ring-state.test.ts` and (structurally + behaviorally) by the
 *   Phase-7 anti-shame guard.
 *
 * AVAILABILITY vs MASTERY — TWO INDEPENDENT INPUTS:
 *   `availability` (`'available' | 'coming-soon'`, from
 *   `@/core/generators/registry`'s `resolveAvailability`) gates `'not-yet-open'`
 *   regardless of any historical aggregate value (a node can theoretically
 *   have residual metrics from a since-removed generator; availability always
 *   wins so the UI never contradicts itself). Above that gate, the aggregate
 *   vs `masteryThreshold` comparison decides `'available' | 'in-progress' | 'mastered'`.

 * @param aggregate    - The stage-04 mastery aggregate scalar (0..1) for this
 *                       node, as read from `parseMasteryMetrics(row.metrics).aggregate`
 *                       or `makeMasteryLookup(...)`. This becomes `fill` verbatim.
 * @param availability - `resolveAvailability(graph)` status for this node
 *                       (`'available'` = generator installed, `'coming-soon'` = not yet).
 * @param config       - Only `masteryThreshold` is read (typically
 *                       `resolveMasteryConfig(node)` or `DEFAULT_MASTERY_CONFIG`),
 *                       so a per-node mastery-config override is honored automatically.

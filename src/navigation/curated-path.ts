/**
 * curated-path.ts — Config-as-data curated entry path (Stage 06, Phase 5).
 *
 * "THE GRAPH SAYS WHAT IS POSSIBLE; THE CURATED PATH SAYS WHAT IS WORTHWHILE"
 *   `CURATED_ENTRY_PATH` is new data OWNED BY this stage — an ordered
 *   progression sequence that RESPECTS the graph (never proposes a
 *   `not-yet-open` node; internally consistent with the DAG's prerequisite
 *   edges among its own members) but is NOT DERIVED from the graph.
 *
 * CONFIG-AS-DATA, SHIPPED-DEFAULTS-NOW:
 *   This is the mechanism + a working default sequence. `pedagogy-pass`
 *   calibrates the exact sequence later as a pure data change — no code
 *   change required. Never hardcode a curated sequence into a call site;
 *   always import `CURATED_ENTRY_PATH` (or an injected override) from here.
 *
 * WHY THE DEFAULT SEQUENCE OMITS THE TWO FOUNDATION NODES:
 *   `addition-within-20` and `unknown-as-missing-addend` are now
 *   generator-backed (as of graphVersion 0.2.1, still true at 0.3.0) and would resolve to `'available'`
 *   per `resolveAvailability()` — they are no longer excluded for
 *   availability reasons. They stay out of the shipped `CURATED_ENTRY_PATH`
 *   for now as a `pedagogy-pass` sequencing decision (the curated path is
 *   authored config-as-data, recalibrated later), not a hard constraint —
 *   `validateCuratedPath` would happily accept them if added. A curated path
 *   entry that resolves to `'coming-soon'` IS still a shipped-time defect
 *   (the whole point of `validateCuratedPath` is to catch that before ship);
 *   the current sequence is ordered so that any prerequisite relationship
 *   BETWEEN two in-path nodes is respected (`multiplication` after
 *   `number-bonds`; `fraction-simplification` after `fruit-equations`).

/**
 * validateCuratedPath(graph, path): string[]
 *
 * Asserts the curated path never references a node absent from the graph and
 * never proposes an unreachable (`'coming-soon'` / not-yet-open) node at ship
 * time, given the currently-registered generator set. As a bonus consistency
 * check, also flags a path node placed BEFORE one of its own prerequisites
 * when that prerequisite is also a member of the same path (never re-orders
 * — only reports violations).
 *
 * Intended to run at startup (e.g. `AppShell`/`App.tsx` init) and in a
 * jest/CI test. Never throws — returns a (possibly empty) violation list so
 * the caller decides how to surface it.
 *
 * @param graph - The loaded `GraphDefinition` (from `loadGraph()`).
 * @param path  - The curated path to validate. Defaults to `CURATED_ENTRY_PATH`.
 * @returns     - Human-readable violation strings. Empty array = valid.
